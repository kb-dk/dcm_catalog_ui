# DCM Catalog UI

This is the end user interface for catalogs created using the [MerMEId
cataloging tool](https://github.com/Det-Kongelige-Bibliotek/MerMEId).
That is, this is a tool for presenting thematic catalogs of music
metadata, based on the the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) XML
schema. As of August 2019 both DCM Catalog UI and MerMEId support MEI
4.0.0.

The following catalogues are known to us as being made using this tool. 

1. DCW [Catalogue of the Works of Frederick Delius](https://delius.music.ox.ac.uk/catalogue/welcome.html) 
2. CNW [The Catalogue of Carl Nielsen's Works](http://www.kb.dk/dcm/cnw/navigation.xq). Printed edition: https://bit.ly/2pzQUx0
3. HartW [J.P.E. Hartmann. Thematic-Bibliographic Catalogue of His Works](http://www.kb.dk/dcm/hartw/navigation.xq). Printed edition: https://bit.ly/2y03rPe
4. SchW [Adolph Scheibe. A Catalogue of His Works](http://www.kb.dk/dcm/schw/navigation.xq). Printed edition: https://bit.ly/2BYoWCL

The last three of are catalogues the works of Danish composers, and
they are also available in printed versions, based on the data in the
digital ones.
