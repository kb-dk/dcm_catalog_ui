			<h2><a name="source_situation">Source materials</a></h2>
			<p>The Royal Library in Copenhagen holds the majority of the surviving sources to
				Nielsen’s music, presumably amounting to more than ninety-five percent of all the
				material. The remaining five percent are found in other Danish and foreign libraries
				among which Musikbiblioteket (Stockholm) and Leipzig Stadtarchiv should be
				mentioned. Apparently only very few manuscripts are still privately owned. </p>
			<p>Rough drafts as well as ink fair copies to most of Nielsen&apos;s larger musical
				works have survived. In some instances, the ink fair copy has entirely or partly
				been produced by a foreign hand (Knud Jeppesen, Nancy Dalberg, Emil Telmányi or
				others), authorized by the composer. Also foreign corrections carried out in the
				manuscripts are in most cases sanctioned and approved by Nielsen.</p>
			<p>Already in 1935, that is four years after the composer&apos;s death and on occasion
				of his seventieth anniversary, a number of prominent individuals led by the
				composer, musicologist and pupil of Nielsen&apos;s, Knud Jeppesen, started gathering
				Nielsen&apos;s surviving manuscripts. In a call for material sent to Nielsen&apos;s
				acquaintances and pupils, they asked for information on manuscripts or other sources
				which the respondents might have in their possession and encouraged them to hand
				over the material to the newly established Carl Nielsen Archive in The Royal Library
				(the enquiry and the replies are kept in The Royal Library, Håndskriftafdelingen,
				Journalsager nr. 4802). </p>
			<p>The appeal made it possible for the Library to establish the archives, in the first
				instance with donations from Hakon Andersen, Harald Balslev, Emilius Bangert, Anders
				Brems, Knud Jeppesen, Alfred Nielsen, Aage Oxenvad, Margrethe Rosenberg and
				Margrethe Schnor. However, in 1935, the majority of Nielsen&apos;s manuscripts were
				still in the family&apos;s possession, in particular his widow, Anne Marie
				Carl-Nielsen. After her death in 1945, Nielsen’s oldest daughter, Irmelin Eggert
				Møller, inherited the collection. Other manuscripts were in the hands of Nielsen’s
				son-in-law, the violinist Emil Telmányi who was married to Nielsen&apos;s second
				daughter Anne Marie. </p>
			<p>Substantial parts of the collection, which since then has become the basis of the
				Carl Nielsen Archives, were handed over to the library in 1958 by Irmelin Eggert
				Møller. Later a series of individual donations were presented by Nielsen’s
				acquaintances and associates of which the last large donation was received in 1991.
				It is most likely that only very few autograph manuscripts remain unknown.</p>
			<p>The Royal Library has organized the material in two distinct collections: <i>Carl
					Nielsen Arkivet</i> (the Carl Nielsen Archive, CNA) containing letters and other
				textual sources, and <i>Carl Nielsens Samling</i> (Carl Nielsen’s Collection, CNS)
				containing musical sources, both manuscripts and prints.</p>
			
			
			<h2><a name="methodology">Methodology and work concept</a></h2>
			<div class="toplink noprint"><a href="#top">To top of page</a></div>
			
			<h3><a name="definition">Definition of &apos;Work&apos;</a></h3>
			<p>The disposition of a catalogue of works presents a series of fundamental problems
				related to the work concept. The catalogue must inevitably operate with an
				either-or: a composition may be seen as either an independent work – hence assigned
				a CNW number – or may fall outside the chosen delimitation and therefore does not
				appear with its own unique number. </p>
			<p>In essence the CNW main catalogue includes compositions which are complete in
				structure though not necessarily so in detail. Works now regarded as lost are
				included if their former existence seems to be evident. Fragments of compositions,
				which as far as is known were never finished, are listed in the <a
					href="appendix.xq">appendix</a> instead. The <a href="appendix.xq">appendix</a>
				also lists Nielsen's arrangements of other composers' works, doubtful and spurious
				compositions, and finally arrangements of Nielsen's works by others. </p>
			<div class="toplink noprint"><a href="#top">To top of page</a></div>
			
			<h3><a name="excerpts">Works and excerpts</a></h3>
			<p>Those instances, where excerpts of works – either in original form or as arrangements
				– have had a separate and significant reception history independent of their
				original context, are more difficult to solve. This applies to a number of songs
				which originally were composed in relation to stage music but were disseminated and
				became known as independent works. In addition, CNW distinguishes between
				instrumental and vocal music: instrumental excerpts of larger works are basically
				not interpreted as independent works. Thus the <i>&apos;Aladdin&apos; Suite</i>, for
				instance, is placed under the music for the play, <i>Musik til Adam Oehlenschlägers
					skuespil &quot;Aladdin eller Den forunderlige Lampe&quot;</i>
				<a class="work_number_reference" title="View work details"
					href="document.xq?doc=cnw0017.xml">CNW 17</a>. Similarly, <i>Taagen letter</i>
				(The Fog is Lifting) is only to be found in relation to <i>Musik til Helge Rodes
					skuespil &quot;Moderen&quot;</i>
				<a class="work_number_reference" href="document.xq?doc=cnw0018.xml"
					title="View work details">CNW 18</a>, in spite of the fact that <i>Taagen
					letter</i>, in various arrangements, is far better known as an independent piece
				than the stage music for the play as a whole.</p>
			<p>Nielsen&apos;s orchestral piece, <i>Saga-Drøm</i>
				<a class="work_number_reference" href="document.xq?doc=cnw0035.xml"
					title="View work details">CNW 35</a>, is on the other hand listed as a separate
				work, even though it was also used as part of the music for the play,
				<i>Moderen</i>. This is due to the fact that Nielsen conceived <i>Saga-Drøm</i> as a
				work of its own several years before he decided to include it in <i>Moderen</i>. </p>
			<p>This general approach was chosen because it is difficult to draw a clear line between
				works and versions otherwise: excerpts and arrangements constitute a continuum
				ranging from re-instrumentations of the work or the grouping of selected movements
				(e.g. the <i>&apos;Aladdin&apos; Suite</i>), over single movements which sometimes
				are performed independently (e.g. <i>Hanedansen</i> from <i>Maskarade</i>
				<a class="work_number_reference" title="View work details"
					href="document.xq?doc=cnw0002.xml">CNW 2</a>) and to actual arrangements of such
				individual movements (e.g. <i>Taagen letter</i>).</p>
			<div class="toplink noprint"><a href="#top">To top of page</a></div>
			
			<h3><a name="songs">Songs originating from plays</a></h3>
			<p>Regarding songs that have their origin in larger contexts, another approach has been
				chosen. Such songs are also listed in the catalogue as individual works – that is,
				if they were also published outside their original context, either separately or as
				part of a collection of songs. One good example worth mentioning is <i>Sangen til
					Danmark</i>
				<a class="work_number_reference" title="View work details"
					href="document.xq?doc=cnw0237.xml">CNW 237</a> that was originally composed for
				the play, <i>Moderen</i>
				<a class="work_number_reference" href="document.xq?doc=cnw0018.xml"
					title="View work details">CNW 18</a>, but which furthermore was published as
				part of an excerpt of the play in piano score and as a four-part arrangement for
				mixed choir. These songs have been assigned with their own CNW number, though they
				also appear as part of another work. </p>
			<div class="toplink noprint"><a href="#top">To top of page</a></div>
			
			<h3><a name="collections">Song collections</a></h3>
			<p>The same applies to those songs which were published in collections, regardless of
				whether they were publications including songs by various composers or collections
				only including songs by Nielsen, and regardless of whether the songs were also
				published separately. These collections make up a continuum ranging from existing
				individual songs, chosen for publication in a broader context (e.g.
					<i>Folkehøjskolens Melodibog</i>), to collections that were composed during a
				coherent period of time and of a more cyclic nature, such as <i>Seks sange til
					tekster af Ludvig Holstein</i>, Op. 10. The songs have been listed as individual
				works (including, of course, the information on the collection(s) of which it was
				part) because 1) it is difficult to draw a clear line between grouped, separate
				songs and actual cycles of songs; and 2) the songs are sometimes also found in other
				contexts. These work criteria imply that a song such as Jeronimus&apos; song
				(&apos;Fordum var her Fred paa Gaden&apos;) from <i>Maskarade</i>
				<a class="work_number_reference" href="document.xq?doc=cnw0002.xml"
					title="View work details">CNW 2</a>, is <em>not</em> listed in CNW as an
				individual work since it, in spite of its popularity in Nielsen&apos;s lifetime, was
				never published by itself. In other words, it is the source situation that
				determines the evaluation of a song&apos;s status as a work rather than its
				reception history.</p>
			<p>Though the song collections have not been assigned one unique CNW number, they are
				described individually. The description of a song collection is contained in one
				record which also includes a listing of the collection&apos;s contents (i.e., those
				songs which the collection contains) as well as the sources related to that
				particular collection. The collection is located by clicking on its title appearing
				under the &apos;Contained in:&apos; heading. The description of a single song of a
				collection, however, is found by proceeding to the song&apos;s title in the index of
				the collection (under the heading &apos;Includes:&apos;).</p>
			<div class="toplink noprint"><a href="#top">To top of page</a></div>
			<h3><a name="arrangements">Arrangements and re-instrumentations</a></h3>
			
			<p>Different arrangements of the same composition are not defined as independent works
				but are included under the same CNW number, also when it comes to songs. This
				overall understanding of &apos;work&apos; implies therefore that there is not a
				one-to-one agreement between a work in CNW and an edition in <a
					href="http://www.kb.dk/en/nb/dcm/cnu/" target="_blank"
					title="The Carl Nielsen Edition">The Carl Nielsen Edition (CNU)</a> in all
				instances; CNU may have several editions under the same CNW number. This applies to
					<i>Hjemvee</i>
				<a class="work_number_reference" href="document.xq?doc=cnw0205.xml">CNW 205</a>, for
				instance (better known with the first line &apos;Underlige Aftenlufte&apos;), which
				is published in CNU in four distinct arrangements of the same melody, all listed
				under the same entry in CNW. Nielsen&apos;s original and lesser known melody to the
				same text has, on the other hand, its own entry (<a class="work_number_reference"
					href="document.xq?doc=cnw0296.xml" title="View work details">CNW 296</a>).</p>
			<p>Also songs employing the same melody but with a different text are regarded as
				distinct compositions: for instance <i>Julesang</i> (1923) <a
					class="work_number_reference" title="View work details"
					href="document.xq?doc=cnw0313.xml">CNW 313</a>, which Nielsen re-used with
				another text in 1924 (&apos;Danevang med grønne bred&apos;) <a
					class="work_number_reference" href="document.xq?doc=cnw0318.xml"
					title="View work details">CNW 318</a>. </p>
			<div class="toplink noprint"><a href="#top">To top of page</a></div>
			
			<h3><a name="order">Order of numbering</a></h3>
			<p>Often Nielsen&apos;s works cannot be dated precisely. They were composed over longer
				periods, and at a later date they were sometimes revised to such an extent that it
				hardly makes sense to assign them to one particular time in Nielsen&apos;s
				production. The CNW numbers are therefore arranged according to genre. </p>
			<p>As to the songs, CNW retains the overall arrangement of the Nielsen Edition. The
				songs are organized as follows according to the songs&apos; original scoring and
				context: <br />&#160;</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td style="padding-top: 8px;">Songs with piano </td>
					<td style="padding-top: 8px;">Songs published in collections<br />Separate

			</table>
			<p>Within each of these categories the chronological order roughly follows the date of
				completion of the first version of the song.</p>
			<p>Exceptions to the sequence of numbers are a few songs and instrumental pieces added
				to the catalogue at a late stage when most numbers had already been assigned and
				published. These 'late-coming' pieces are listed at the end of the main sections to
				which they belong (instrumental works and vocal music, respectively).</p>

			<h2><a name="howto">How to use the catalogue</a></h2>
			<p>The catalogue&apos;s primary entry to the records is the list of work titles. In a
				column to the left of the titles, it is possible to modify and limit the search
				results, while at the top of the list there are different settings as to how the
				results may be displayed.</p>
			<div class="toplink noprint"><a href="#top">To top of page</a></div>
			
			<h3><a name="searching">Filtering and searching</a></h3>
			<p>On the menu at the left side of the display, the following possibilities to change or
				limit the search are listed:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Keywords: free text search (may for example be used for searching places or
					genre keywords). The search is not case sensitive but boolean operators (AND,
					OR) must be uppercase. Search terms may be truncated with an asterisk (*).
					Click the &apos;Search&apos; button at the bottom of the search form to start searching.</li>
				<li>Title: searches within the titles of works and movements only, including 
				subtitles, alternative titles and translated titles.</li>
				<li>Name: select from the list of names to search for records mentioning a particular person.
					Then click the &apos;Search&apos; button at the bottom of the search form.</li>
				<li>Numbers: select the type of number (CNW, Opus, or FS) from the first list and the 
					desired number from the second list. Click the &apos;Search&apos; button to start searching.</li>
				<li>Year of composition: the search may be limited to works that are composed in a
					particular period by entering the desired year span and clicking the
					&apos;Search&apos; button. Searching by year includes all works completed <!--or in
					progress--> during the desired period.</li>
				<li>Genre: by clicking on a genre designation, the search is limited to those works
					that are listed under that particular genre as the work&apos;s primary genre.
					Other genre designation such as 'cantata' may be searched for using the keyword
					search field. </li>
				<!--<li>Song collections: as a standard the list of search includes not only the
					individual songs by Nielsen but also the song collections in which they appeared
					such as <i>Folkehøjskolens Melodibog</i> or <i>Salmer og aandelige Sange</i>. In
					order to exclude such collections from the search results, the checkbox
					&apos;Exclude anthologies&apos; must be ticked off.</li>-->
			</ul>
			<p>All search limitations function additively, that is, a simultaneous use of several
				search parameters confines the result further (logically &apos;AND&apos;). Each
				delimiting parameter (filter) is shown at the top of the list of search results when
				the search has been completed. Each filter may be removed one at a time by clicking
				on the delete symbol <span
					style="background-color: #515151; border-radius: 4px; display: inline-table;"
						><img style="vertical-align:middle" src="style/images/filter_remove.png"
						alt="&apos;delete&apos; symbol" /></span> at the filter in question, thus
				expanding the search again. Filters may be removed all at once by clicking on the
				red &apos;Reset all&apos; button in the list of filters. </p>
			<div class="toplink noprint"><a href="#top">To top of page</a></div>
			
			<h3><a name="sorting">Display and sorting of search results</a></h3>
			<p>The search result is displayed as a list of work titles. By default, only twenty
				search results are shown at a time. They reader may navigate through the result
				pages using the numbered navigation buttons above the result list. The number of
				results per page can be changed by selecting a different number in the select box
				above the navigation buttons.</p>
			<p>The sort order of the results can be changed with the other select box next to the
				works-per-page selector. Possible sort orders are CNW number (default),
				alphabetically by title, and chronologically by year of composition. The
				chronological sorting, however, is only a rough approximation. It takes into account
				only the year in which the composition was completed. Undated works are listed
				first. Clicking on a work&apos;s title opens the detailed view.</p>
			<div class="toplink noprint"><a href="#top">To top of page</a></div>
			<h2><a name="contents">The structure and contents of each record</a></h2>
			<p>A certain amount of information is displayed directly on each record. For the sake of
				clarity, other data may be hidden under the tabs with a plus sign <img
					src="style/images/plus.png" alt="plus sign" />, that is &apos;Music&apos;,
				&apos;Performances&apos;, &apos;Sources&apos;, &apos;Documents&apos; and
				&apos;Bibliography&apos;. By clicking on the sign the hidden information will unfold
				and may be closed again. </p>
			<div class="toplink noprint"><a href="#top">To top of page</a></div>
			
			<h3><a name="titles">Work titles</a></h3>
			<p>Precise titles are kept thus reproducing Nielsen&apos;s original orthography. They
				reveal changes in Nielsen&apos;s spelling and punctuation habits throughout his life
				and are apparent in titles such as <i>Har Haand du lagt paa Herrens Plov</i>
				<a class="work_number_reference" title="View work details"
					href="document.xq?doc=cnw0173.xml">CNW 173</a> and <i>Jeg gik i marken og
					vogtede får</i>
				<a class="work_number_reference" title="View work details"
					href="document.xq?doc=cnw0327.xml">CNW 327</a>. From an orthographical point of
				view, the titles in general expose a heterogeneous and a seemingly inconsistent
				practice which, however, has been retained rather than modernized, partly because
				modernized spelling would be just as dated (though to a later time) and partly
				because modernization is also a question of degree which in the extreme would not
				only include spelling and punctuation but also the choice of words. Furthermore, the
				variations in Nielsen’s orthography not simply reflect general changes of his time
				but also a conscious choice of orthography according to context. It may be noted,
				for instance, that <i>Der sad en fisker så tankefuld</i> was actually composed
				several years before <i>Tyst som Aa i Engen rinder</i>.</p>
			<p>Several of Nielsen&apos;s songs were published in various contexts with distinct
				orthographies: <i>Melodier til Sangbogen Danmark</i> (1924), for example, employs
				the older orthography while <i>Folkehøjskolens Melodibog</i> (1922) uses the modern.
				As a rule, CNW reproduces the orthography of the earliest published title. In the
				description of the contents of the song collections the titles are rendered as in
				the collection concerned.</p>
			<p>Titles that are similar to genre designations have – as have instrument designations
				– been standardized and modernized such as <i>Kvartet for to violiner, bratsch og
					cello</i> (Quartet for Two Violins, Viola and Cello) <a
					class="work_number_reference" title="View work details"
					href="document.xq?doc=cnw0049.xml">CNW 49</a>. Incidental music has been given
				titles such as <i>Musik til Ludvig Holsteins skuespil "Tove"</i> (Music for Ludvig
				Holstein&apos;s Play &apos;Tove&apos;) <a class="work_number_reference"
					title="View work details" href="document.xq?doc=cnw0010.xml">CNW 10</a>, because
				the title <i>Tove</i> would refer to the play as a whole.</p>
			<p>Many of the songs were never provided with an actual title by Nielsen; in these cases
				the first line of the text has been added as title. In the remaining instances the
				text incipit is given as the alternative title, also when the song is better known
				by its first line (e.g. <i>Hjemvee</i>
				<a class="work_number_reference" title="View work details"
					href="document.xq?doc=cnw205.xml">CNW 205</a>, better known as &apos;Underlige
				Aftenlufte&apos;).</p>
			<div class="toplink noprint"><a href="#top">To top of page</a></div>
			
			<h3><a name="identification">Identification</a></h3>
			<p>In addition to the actual CNW number, the catalogue provides each work&apos;s number
				in an array of other contexts including Nielsen&apos;s own opus numbers, <a
					class="abbr" href="javascript:void(0);">FS (Fog/Schousboe)<span class="expan"
						>Dan Fog and Torben Schousboe: <i>Carl Nielsen. Kompositioner. En
							Bibliografi</i>. Copenhagen 1965</span></a> numbers and the work&apos;s
				manuscript shelf-mark in the Carl Nielsen Collection (CNS) in The Royal Library. </p>
			<p>Furthermore, each record lists the work&apos;s number in the Nielsen Edition (CNU).
				The numbers signify series and volume. The song numbers are preceded by a comma. If
				several versions occur in the same CNU volume these are separated by yet a comma;
				versions in other volumes are divided by a semicolon. Thus &apos;CNU III/5, 146,
				229; III/6, 324&apos; refers to numbers 146, 229, and 324 in the Nielsen Edition of
				which the two first-mentioned are in Series III (songs) volume 5, whereas the latter
				is in Series III volume 6.</p>
			<p>Then follows the name of a possible text author. </p>
			<p>Each song record includes a link titled &apos;Carl Nielsen Edition (Editorial
				Texts)&apos; referring to a PDF file of the text volume to all the songs. Since the
				information regarding each song (history, English translation of the lyrics, source
				descriptions and list of revisions) is found in various sections of the volume, the
				link does not refer to a particular page. Information on each song is located by
				referring to the index at the end of the volume.</p>
			<p>If the work is related to other works or song collections this has been indicated by
				clickable titles linking to information placed under their CNW numbers. </p>
			<div class="toplink noprint"><a href="#top">To top of page</a></div>
			
			<h3><a name="history">The work&apos;s history</a></h3>
			<p>The information on the work&apos;s history includes a brief summary of its genesis,
				dating, the first known performance and sometimes also a few other performances.
				Besides the date of the performance, also place, participants and in some cases
				information regarding reviews are included.</p>
			<p>As Nielsen's works often were composed over longer periods, it is difficult to date
				them precisely. In addition, at a later stage some were even revised to such an
				extent that it seems meaningless to give them a specific date. The following terms
				have been employed in CNW: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>‘Between... and...’ is used when it has been possible to define the period in
					which the work has been composed.</li>
				<li>A sequence of years such as ‘1913–19’ is indicated when Nielsen has been
					working on the music regularly throughout the period.</li>
				<li>‘c.’ is used when it has not been possible to assign a specific year, though
					based on other circumstances it has been possible to provide an approximate
					date.</li>
				<li>A date in square brackets ([ ]) indicates the latest possible date; it is used
					when the year of composition has not been possible to determine. The year might
					be the date of publication or a performance, for instance.</li>
				<li>A year without square brackets is used when the date is certain, though it has
					not been possible to identify it further.</li>
				<li>Month and year is employed when it has been possible, using other sources such
					as letters, to determine that Nielsen worked on the composition and finished it
					within a particular month.</li>
				<li>A precise date is indicated when the work has been dated in the musical sources,
					in his diaries or his drafts.</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="toplink noprint"><a href="#top">To top of page</a></div>
			
			<h3><a name="music">Instrumentation and movements</a></h3>
			<p>If there are different instrumentations of the same work, this will normally be
				indicated under each version. For an unambiguous identification, CNW provides
				incipits including the first bars of the composition&apos;s main parts (movements,
				scenes or similar). Works of a more extensive instrumentation are provided with
				incipits in short score. By clicking on an incipit, a larger image appears in a
				separate window. Incipits are based on <a href="http://www.kb.dk/en/nb/dcm/cnu/"
					target="_blank" title="The Carl Nielsen Edition">CNU</a> and therefore do not
				necessarily reproduce the exact reading of one particular source.</p>
			<p>It should be noted that the music in some of the sources might be notated in a
				different key than the one in the incipit.</p>
			<p>The term ‘incipit’ is to be understood literally: incipits show the beginning of the
				work in its realized form. Repeat markings at the beginning of a movement are
				omitted, if the passage to be repeated is longer than the incipit. If the work
				begins with an extensive introduction (e.g. a prelude to a song), it is not only the
				first bars that are shown but also the beginning of the main section such as the
				beginning of the vocal part. No attempt has been made to reflect analytical
				interpretations such as first and second subjects. Technical indications such as
				fingerings and bowings are omitted unless the work has a distinctly instructive
				purpose (e.g. the three pieces for langeleik <a class="work_number_reference"
					title="View work details" href="document.xq?doc=cnw0071.xml">CNW 71</a>). </p>
			<p>In records of works of a more complex structure, such as operas divided into acts,
				scenes and sections of scenes, the information constitutes a hierarchy of each
				individual element that may be folded out by clicking on the &apos;Sections&apos;
				heading.</p>
			<p>A link marked &apos;Carl Nielsen Edition&apos; leads to a PDF file of that volume (or
				volumes) of the Nielsen Edition containing the composition. Some works, which were
				originally published in a composite volume, were also published as soft-bound
				off-prints, for example the flute and clarinet concertos. In these instances, the
				link refers to the off-prints. </p>

			<h3><a name="sources">Sources</a></h3>
			<p>The overview of sources includes only those from Nielsen&apos;s
				lifetime, and directly related to Nielsen; it also includes sources representing his
				own versions of the works. Other composers&apos; arrangements of Nielsen&apos;s
				works are thus not included included in the main catalogue; please refer to the <a
					href="appendix.xq" title="CNW Appendix">appendix</a> for a list of arrangements
				by Nielsen’s contemporaries. </p>
			<p>The source descriptions are minimal, providing only the most basic information for
				identification. More detailed descriptions are available in the volumes of <a
					href="http://www.kb.dk/en/nb/dcm/cnu/" target="_blank"
					title="The Carl Nielsen Edition">CNU</a>. To
				facilitate the consultation, CNW lists CNU&apos;s source designation (e.g. &apos;CNU
				Source <b>A</b>&apos;). The appropriate CNU volumes are available via the mentioned
				link.</p>
			<p>The sources are given a descriptive title indicating the type of source such as
				&apos;Score, autograph, fair copy&apos;. &apos;Autograph&apos; with no further
				qualification designates that the source&apos;s main hand is Nielsen&apos;s. In some
				cases a name is added after &apos;autograph&apos; – for instance, &apos;autograph
				(Henrik Knudsen)&apos; – indicating that the manuscript is not by Nielsen; nor that
				it is merely a copy or transcript of Nielsen&apos;s manuscript: the difference
				between sources listed as a copy and as an autograph (with a name added) is that the
				latter intentionally adds original content to the work. </p>
			<p>A systematic classification of the source is given after the title. The
				classification indicates the content type of the source (musical or textual), type
				of production (manuscript or print), authority (autograph or copy), position in the
				compositional process (sketch, draft, fair copy etc.), type of scoring (such as
				score, short score or parts) and completeness (complete, incomplete, excerpt,
				fragment). &apos;Incomplete&apos; is used in cases where the source represents the
				entire composition but some material is missing (for instance, a set of parts with
				one or more parts missing); &apos;excerpt&apos; describes a source intentionally
				omitting sections of the overall composition, while &apos;fragment&apos; is used
				when the source is left unfinished or portions of it have been lost (for instance, a
				sketch of the first bars only, or a copy of the score with one or more pages
				missing). </p>

			<h3><a name="documents">Documents</a></h3>
			<p>The &apos;Documents&apos; section lists contemporary manuscript documents such as
				letters to and from Nielsen as well as Nielsen&apos;s diaries. The information is
				based on the <a class="abbr" href="javascript:void(0);"><i>Carl Nielsen
						Brevudgaven</i><span class="expan">John Fellow (ed.): <i>Carl Nielsen
							Brevudgaven</i>. Multivers, Copenhagen 2005-. </span></a> (Carl Nielsen
				Letters).</p>
			<p>References do not yet include letters from Nielsen&apos;s latest years but they will
				be added as soon as possible when the complete edition is available. </p>
			<p>In so far as it has been possible, references to letters dealing with actual songs
				have been listed under the specific song rather than the collection or those
				collections in which the song appeared. Letters mentioning a song collection or
				unspecified songs from a collection are, however, listed under the collection.</p>

			<h3><a name="bibliography">Bibliography</a></h3>
			<p>The bibliography lists contemporary as well as posthumous literature dealing with the
				work in question. More references are currently being added, based on compilations
				such as Mina F. Miller, <i>Carl Nielsen. A guide to research</i> (New York 1987),
				the current bibliography on Nielsen literature published in the journal <i><a
