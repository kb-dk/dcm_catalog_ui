      <h1>Preface</h1>
      <p>The <i>Catalogue of Carl Nielsen&apos;s Works</i> (CNW) is the first ever thematic-bibliographic registration of all
        Nielsen&apos;s compositions. A few catalogues have previously been
        prepared of which <a class="abbr" 
			     href="javascript:void(0);">Fog and Schousboe&apos;s<span class="expan">Dan Fog and Torben Schousboe: 
            <i>Carl Nielsen. Kompositioner. En Bibliografi</i>. Copenhagen 1965</span></a> bibliography (1965) was the first.
        Also the <a class="abbr" 
                    href="javascript:void(0);">Bjørnum and
          Møllerhøj<span 
                      class="expan">Birgit Bjørnum and Klaus Møllerhøj, <i>Carl Nielsens
              Samling. Katalog over komponistens musikhåndskrifter i Det kongelige Bibliotek</i>. Copenhagen 1992</span></a>  
        description of Nielsen&apos;s manuscripts in The Royal Danish Library (1992) is
        one of the most important groundworks. 
        Strictly speaking, however, none of these are catalogues of <i>works</i>. Their numberings are mainly 
        related to bibliographical items – prints (FS) and manuscripts (CNS), respectively. 
        Though they may to some degree serve as work catalogues, there is no strict 
        one-to-one relationship between compositions and the catalogue numbers. For instance, 
        FS numbers song collections (i.e. publications) rather than the individual songs; 
        therefore, a single song may have as many as four different FS numbers, 
        none of which can be used to identify the particular song. </p> 
      <p>The first complete survey of all Nielsen&apos;s compositions and their sources was not initiated,
        however, until the foundation of the <a href="https://www.kb.dk/en/find-materials/collections/sheet-music-collection/music-editions-and-lists-works-royal-danish-library" target="_blank"

            <i>Carl Nielsen Udgaven</i>. The Royal Library: Copenhagen 1998–2009</span></a>. In more than one sense, 
        CNW is a natural extension of CNU and builds to a large degree on information accumulated 
        in connection with the editing project and to a certain extent also in connection with other projects. 
        The information has been rectified when the editors either have been aware of 
        or had their attention drawn to errors. However, due to limited resources the editors 
        have not been able to verify all information systematically. 
        Original sources have only been consulted in cases of doubt. </p>
      <p>The Danish Centre for Music Editing which is responsible for the publication of CNW was established at The
        Royal Danish Library shortly after the completion of the Carl Nielsen Edition in order to 
        maintain and carry on the music philological
        expertise and not least exploit the detailed knowledge of Nielsen&apos;s works that
        had been gathered during the working on the complete edition. 
      </p>
      <p>Biographical as well as bibliographic information has also been drawn from a number of other
        sources, among others <a class="abbr" href="javascript:void(0);">Nielsen's letters<span class="expan">John Fellow (ed.), <i>Carl
          Nielsen Brevudgaven</i>. Copenhagen 2005–2015.<br/>
